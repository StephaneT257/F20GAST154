OBJECT 1 & 2: GOOD-GUY AND BAD-GUY 
To match the desired art style of my scene, very low fidelity models resembling a lego game of sorts, i used a lot of the geometric shapes that can be added to models in blender. For certain items such as the head of my charecter i utilised the sculpting tools to both square out the head shape and additionally to create the ears, i added ears to give the heads a sense of charecter. Materials consisted of a lot of colour blocking which is common in this kind of low fidelity modeling, a lot of material tampering was done in the additional settings to get texturing correct. In GOOD-GUY model (found in v1) there are smaller details that add to the charecter such as the sheath and sheath holder, which are nice details that where quite timely but added a lot of value visually.

OBJECT 3: GLOCK
As a weapon for BAD-GUY i created a pistol, this was created by placing a reference image flat in blender and then creating planes above to track and cover general shape. I then used extruding and moving certain vertexes to get the shape covered from the reference image, i then extruded the whole plane and began beveling edges to allow for a smoother looking model. In terms of texturing and modeling, i sampled hex codes from images of glocks online, and then with the setting tools added metal effects for things such as the reciever and trigger, and then unsured roughness was high on the grip ect.

OBJECT 4: SWORD
As a weapon for good guy i created a sword, this was modeled similarily to the glock in which i placed a reference image and then used the extruding and adding of planes to create a "2d" plane atop of my image, i then extended the plane to make it thicker and then beveled edges that were to be sharp or circular such as the handle and blade. Made use of some of the settings in material tab in order to make the sword appear both metialic and shiny/reflective in its render.
