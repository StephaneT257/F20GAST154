ANIMATION

Exporting of all objects were rather problematic, my head shapes originally in blender didnt have any smoothing which meant the texturing in UE appeared shaddowed and reddened in certain issues, this issue was solved by going back into blender and applying some remeshing modifers the issue was resolved. Additionally some facial features needed to be remodeled in UE as they would become transparent when viewed from certain angles. Lighting also needed to be recreated in UE but this turned out to be better in my opinion.
